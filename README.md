# CryptoClustering
This repository is for a homework assignment for the edX Data Visualization Bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. Based on the skills we have been learning in Module 19 - Unsupervised Learning, and the provided starter code, I have completed this assignment to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

This assignment uses modules form scikit-learn and hvplot.pandas to make predictions and visualize the data. The first part of the assignment is for analysis on the entire provided dataframe made from the crypto_market_data.csv file found in resources. The second part of the assignment uses similar techniques with Principal Component Analysis on a scaled DataFrame with fewer features.
